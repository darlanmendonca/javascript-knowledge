## Number

Another variable type in Javascript is the type Number.

Is very common in other languages have two or more types to numbers, it is typically a Type integer, and other of type float. sendo normalmente um do tipo inteiro, e outro de tipo flutuante. 

```
// Examples of integers:
5
10
22
```

```
// and floats
10.5
0.5
3.3232
102.20
```

However in Javascript, integer numbers or floats and floating numbers are actually the same type of variable, Number. We will see later methods to allow us treat these numbers with the precision we desire.

For now, to create a variable of type Number in Javascript, just assign a value, different of Strings, dont be necessary any special symbol, e.g: 

```js
var averageSizeDragon = 68.5;
var amountDragons = 3;
```

We will see more operators in other article, but if you want to advance, below we use some simple operators, to sum, subtract, divide and multiply:

```js
// soma
10 + 10
amountDragons + 1
```

Dont forget to test using the `console.log`.

```js
// subtraction
10 - 5
amountDragons - 2
```

```js
// multiplication
10 * 10
amountDragons * averageSizeDragon
```

```js
// division
32 / 3
32 / 2
amountDragons / averageSizeDragon
```
